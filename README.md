# üéÆ Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax Algorithm

## üåê Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an unbeatable computer opponent using the Minimax algorithm. The game is played in the console, and players take turns making moves until there is a winner or a draw.

## Setup
- The game is played on a 3x3 board.
- The player is represented by 'O', and the computer opponent is represented by 'X'.
- The game board is represented by a dictionary where each key corresponds to a position on the board (1-9).

## How to Play
1. Players take turns making moves by entering the position where they want to place their 'O'.
2. The computer opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
3. The game continues until there is a winner or a draw

## Run the Game
Simply run the provided Python script in your preferred environment:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe_minimax.py
```
## Game Logic
- The game uses the minimax algorithm to determine the computer's optimal moves.
- The `minimax` function recursively evaluates possible future moves to find the best move for both the player and the computer.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the code to enhance the game or integrate it into a larger project. You can explore adding a graphical interface or expanding the game's features.

## Acknowledgments
This implementation is based on the traditional rules of Tic-Tac-Toe and the Minimax algorithm for optimal decision-making by the computer opponent.
